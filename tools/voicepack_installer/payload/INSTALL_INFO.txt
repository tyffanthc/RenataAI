RenataAI Voice Pack (Piper PL) - install info

Default install path:
%APPDATA%\RenataAI\voice\piper

Renata auto-detects Piper Voice Pack when installed in APPDATA
(recommended for standard onefile release).

If you use a portable/onedir build, choose a custom path and install
the Voice Pack next to RenataAI.exe with this structure:

<Renata folder>\voice\piper\piper.exe
<Renata folder>\voice\piper\models\pl_PL-gosia-medium.onnx
<Renata folder>\voice\piper\models\pl_PL-gosia-medium.json

The runtime files (DLL + espeak-ng-data) must remain in the same folder
as piper.exe.
